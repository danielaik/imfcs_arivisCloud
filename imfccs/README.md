# Introduction 
This module performs autocorrelations of green and red image stacks acquired from camera-based Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and its cross-correlation. Analysis results such as diffusion coefficient, and cross-correlation amount for each pixels will be displayed in a html file for visualization. The module works with any 16-bit or 32-bit image stacks in any of the standard file formats: TIFF, OME-TIFF, TIF
This module has 2 input:
* Input image stacks 16-bit/ 32-bit from green channel
* Input image stacks 16-bit/ 32-bit from red channel
